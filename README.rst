Neuroscience software survey 2011
=================================

This repository contains the data of a survey that was conducted by the
NeuroDebian project to gather data on software usage in neuroscience.

For now, only the raw data is available. However, analysis scripts,
and the manuscript of the associated publication will be added later on.


Data format
-----------

Each survey response is stored in a separate file in JSON format. The
dictionary ID correspond to the field IDs of the original HTML survey form
that is available at http://neuro.debian.net/survey/2011/questionnaire.html

The data has been filtered to exclude duplicate submissions, and all IP
addresses have been anonymized by removing the last two 8-bit segments.
